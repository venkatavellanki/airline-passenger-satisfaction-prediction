# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

This project applies **Decision Tree** and **Naive Bayes** machine learning algorithms to predict airline passenger satisfaction.

It was developed as a mini-project for the **DMA (Data Mining and Analytics)** course during **Semester 7** at **SRM Institute of Science and Technology**.
